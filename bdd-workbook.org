* CDL Goal
  The goal of this CDL is for you and your classmates to think about and discuss
  what you (will have) learned about problem solving from grappling with the
  problem of showing the Equivalence of Combinational Circuits (ECC) and relate
  it to what you have already learned about problem solving.

* TODO Construct and Show
  Construct BDDs from two combinational circuits and use their BDDs to show that
  the two circuits are not equivalent --- i.e., find an input that returns
  different outputs in the two circuits.

  [[https://rickneff.github.io/img/two-inequivalent-circuits.pdf][Here are the schematics of the two circuits]], call them A and B.

  Hint: Use the [[http://formal.cs.utah.edu:8080/pbl/BDD.php][PBDD tool]] introduced in the book.
