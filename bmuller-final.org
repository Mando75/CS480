* On Free Will and Determinism
Free will and the omniscience of God are mutually exclusive ideas. If God is
truly omniscient then He already knows what the outcomes of our lives will be,
thereby making our eventual destiny deterministic, predestined, unavoidable. If
this is the case, how can anyone argue for the existence of an omniscient God
who has created beings with free will? 

Humans crave meaning. Throughout history we have devised methods to describe and
make sense of the universe around us and our place in it. We began first with
gods to explain the unknown forces shaping the world around us. Eventually
insightful men and women realized that these forces were not random. They could
be quantified, measured, and to an extent, predicted. This led scientists to
develope a deterministic view of the universe. French scientist Pierre-Simon
Laplace is even reported to have said something along the lines of the
following (paraphrased), if at one time we knew the positions and speeds of all the particles
in the universe, then we could calculate their behaviour at any other time, in
the past or future. Obviously this computation would be incredibly complex, but
Laplace and others held that it would be theoretically possible. What they may
have not anticipated was how these discoveries would begin to conflict with
their previous notions about the nature of God. Does a deterministic
mathematical and scientific view of the world lead to the removal of the
necessity of deity?

Mathematics can be described as the language of the universe. Using mathematics
as a foundation, the sciences of physics, biology, chemistry, etc have been able
to create a magnificent description of the natural world around us. But what is
mathematics grounded in? This is one of the questions at the foundations of
number and computational theory, and still a hotly debated topic. One could make
the argument that our understanding of the universe could stem from our
understanding of mathematics. If mathematics is a construction of humankind's
intuition or simple philosophical view of the world, does that indicate that we
have locked /ourselves/ in a potentially deterministic box? On the other hand,
if the foundation of mathematics can be found in logic or Platonism, how does
one reconcile the inferred determinism of these models with free will?

Kurt G\ouml{}del showed, quite paradoxically, that no consistent set of axioms can be
algorithmically listed which would be capable of proving all arithmetic truths.
This leads to the undeniable conclusion that there exist some truths, though
known to be true, cannot be proven as such. G\ouml{}del's work when paired with the
work of mathematicians Alonso Church and Alan Turing showed that with only a
finite logical system, not only can we never programmatically describe all
truths, but that we can not even know the output of all the programs we create
[[[https://rickneff.github.io/the-ocean-of-truth.pdf][1]]]. As Rudy Rucker so eloquently described in his essay [[https://rickneff.github.io/the-ocean-of-truth.pdf][/The Ocean of Truth/]],
if this were not the case, every human activity would be listable and
computable. This would imply that we are stuck in a finite, deterministic
universe where every action you make could be precalculated. You would like to
become a computer scientist? Here are the exact steps /you/ must follow to
achieve it. Thankfully, due to the work of G\ouml{}del and others, we know this is not
the case.

This nondeterministic view is further backed up by quantam theory. In Dr. Stephen
Hawking's essay [[http://www.hawking.org.uk/does-god-play-dice.html][/Does God Play Dice?/]], he delves into this very question about
determinism and free will [2]. His conclusion from a physicist's perspective is that
the universe is not deterministic. He ends his essay with the following:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To sum up, what I have been talking about, is whether the universe evolves in an
arbitrary way, or whether it is deterministic. The classical view, put forward
by Laplace, was that the future motion of particles was completely determined,
if one knew their positions and speeds at one time. This view had to be
modified, when Heisenberg put forward his Uncertainty Principle, which said that
one could not know both the position, and the speed, accurately. However, it was
still possible to predict one combination of position and speed. But even this
limited predictability disappeared, when the effects of black holes were taken
into account. The loss of particles and information down black holes meant that
the particles that came out were random. One could calculate probabilities, but
one could not make any definite predictions. Thus, the future of the universe is
not completely determined by the laws of science, and its present state, as
Laplace thought. God still has a few tricks up his sleeve.
#+END_QUOTE

What then, does a nondeterministic universe impy for the concept of an
omniscient God? If our universe is non-determinstic, how then can there exist a
God with a knowledge of our past, present, and future without contradicting the
laws He supposedly created? While I do not claim to have *the* answer to this
question, I do have some thoughts and insights that I believe are worth
discussing.

My instinct is to follow a traditional line of thinking put forward by
theologians like C.S. Lewis, which is that God exists on a plane outside of time
where he observes all of our time at once. In his book /Mere Christianity/,
Lewis expounds with the following [3]: 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call
"tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All
the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He
simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not.
He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them:
because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never
supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows
what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same
wayâ€”because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He
does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which
you have done it is already "Now" for Him.
#+END_QUOTE

An answer along these lines, while not stemming from any concrete logical
deduction or proof, does seem to align nicely with the doctrine often repeated
in Holy Writ that God's course is "one eternal round." Through this view, God is
omniscient not because He knows exactly what choices we will make in our lives,
but because he sees our entire life as one complete whole. We are still free to
choose, and He will know the outcome, but not because He determined it to be so.

* On Disobedience to Higher Laws

Elder N. Eldon Tanner said, "Law is the simple application of truth. [4]" 

Why does it seem that advanced intelligences are free to disobey the higher
laws set forth by God? I would argue that they are not. 

God has put forth both spiritual and physical laws to govern our universe. As
physical beings, we are bound to obey, one way or the other, the physical laws
of the universe God has set forth. We cannot simply "choose" to disregard
gravity. The law has hold on us, whether we like it or not. To disregard it is
to invite physical peril into our lives. I believe the same holds with the
spiritual laws God has set forth. 

Yes, it may seem that many men and women disregard the laws of God seemingly
without consequence, but we have been repeatedly taught that there is a day of
reckoning coming, a day when all men will be held accountable for their deeds,
whether good or evil. Just like choosing to disregard the law of gravity may
lead to serious physical injury or death, disregarding the spiritual laws of God
will result in spiritual harm and death. The consequence may not be immediete,
but it will come nonetheless.

It seems we have come into this world with bodies which understand and willingly
obey the physical laws of the universe. This provides us with a level of
*computational output* to operate from. However, our main purpose in coming here
has been to learn to freely obey the spiritual laws God has set forth, further
increasing our output. Perhaps this can be viewed as a step on the heirarchy of
languages. A regular language has some computational power, but like our
obedience to the physical laws, is limited in what its computational power can
produce. Learning to obey the spiritual laws would move us up the language
heirarchy to a sphere which is more computationally powerful. 

* Deciding a Halting Problem
** What is the program computing?
   This program is an implementation of Conway's PRIMEGAME which is a method to
   generate prime numbers. The program uses FRACTRAN (a Turing-complete
   language) to generate the prime powers of 2.
** How does it do it?
   OEIS provides a great writeup of how the PRIMEGAME works, which I will
   paraphrase here [5].

   Given a sequence of 14 rational numbers,

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp :results code
   (require 'calc-math)
   (setq flibbers (list 17 78 19 23 29 77 95 77 1 11 13 15 15 55)
         flobbers (list 91 85 51 38 33 29 23 19 17 13 11 14 2 1))
   (mapcar* 'math-make-frac flibbers flobbers)
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
   ((frac 17 91)
    (frac 78 85)
    (frac 19 51)
    (frac 23 38)
    (frac 29 33)
    (frac 77 29)
    (frac 95 23)
    (frac 77 19)
    (frac 1 17)
    (frac 11 13)
    (frac 13 11)
    (frac 15 14)
    (frac 15 2)
    55)
   #+END_SRC

   starting with i = 2, find the first number in the sequence that when
   multiplied by i produces an integer. Set i to that integer. This will
   generate a sequence such that when the binary logarithm of n is an integer,
   it will be a prime number (checking if it is an integer is handled nicely by
   'math-integer-log2). This then generates the noncomposite powers of 2, or in
   other words, the prime powers of two.

   I would like to quote directly from the OEIS wiki page, as I think it
   provides perhaps a clearer insight into how one could think of this program
   as a machine. 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It may be helpful to think of the "machine" as an actual machine, with an intake
on one end and an outtake on the other end. A workpiece, in this case, a power
of 2, is fed into the intake, the machine is activated and after making some
noise and shaking, the workpiece comes out the other end transformed into
another power of 2. And of course we can take this new power of 2 and put it
into the intake once again.
#+END_QUOTE

** Will it ever terminate?
With this machine sequence, no the program will never halt. The last number in
the machine sequence is the whole number 55. This guarantees that if none of the
previous numbers in the sequence multiplied by i produces an integer, the 55
will (remember that i only gets changed when it is multiplied by one of the
fractions to produce a new integer). This is quite elegant, because as
we know, there is an infinite number of primes. It therefore seems appropriate
that a program designed to produce the prime powers of 2 would also never halt.
